// Live planar mirrors — extracted from StoreScene (three-scene.ts keeps
// one-line delegating stubs). The cornice band and the front soffit ring are
// three.js Reflectors: each renders the whole scene again from its own
// viewpoint, which is the single most expensive thing in the frame at catalog
// scale. This module decides which machines get them at all, how often a stale
// reflection is allowed to redraw, and which mirror that redraw is spent on.
//
// Every function takes the StoreScene as its first parameter and reads/writes
// scene state exactly as the original methods did.
//
// BOX-PROJECTED CUBEMAPS DO NOT WORK HERE — tried 2026-08-11, measured, and
// reverted, so nobody spends another day on it. The pitch is seductive: bake
// the room into one cubemap, box-project the reflected ray against the room's
// bounds, and every mirror becomes one texture fetch with nothing to refresh.
// Box projection is exact when the reflected geometry lies ON the box, and
// this store is a rectangular room, so the room IS the box... except it isn't.
// The room is a box PACKED with 7 ft shelving runs, endcaps, floor displays
// and a checkout counter, and that furniture — not the walls — is what these
// mirrors actually reflect. Everything between the capture point and the shell
// gets projected out onto the shell, so the counter smears across the band at
// several times its true size and the aisles vanish entirely. It reads as a
// rendering fault, not a mirror. Per-mirror cubes would fix only the face they
// were captured for, and an env-mapped cube with no box projection at all is
// just the chrome fallback below, which already exists.

 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT MAKE A REFRESH CHEAPER, all measured on the 4K --full profile,
 * so nobody repeats them: a refresh costs ~5-8ms and that number will not move.
 * Dropping the reflector target from 1024px to 256px changes it by nothing.
 * Hiding every movie box AND every shelf carcass in the store changes it by
 * nothing either (7.08 -> 7.02ms). It is neither fill nor the scene's draw
 * calls, which rules out proxy geometry and baked shelf textures — there is
 * nothing cheaper to reflect.
 *
 * Beware one seductive measurement: hoisting these renders out of
 * onBeforeRender appears to take a refresh to 0.25ms. It does not. That average
 * is collected while the round-robin is mostly refreshing OFF-SCREEN mirrors,
 * whose virtual camera faces a wall and renders almost nothing. A mirror you
 * can see costs the full ~8ms wherever the render is issued from — so the
 * refresh RATE is the only real lever, which is why the stride below stays.
 *
 * Since the cost is fixed, the game is spending the budget well, and that is
 * what driving the renders from here buys over the stock onBeforeRender hook:
 * inside the hook a mirror can only refresh itself in scene draw order, so the
 * budget lands on whichever mirror happens to be drawn first — usually one
 * behind the camera. Here we can pick. Off-screen mirrors are skipped entirely
 * and stay sticky-dirty until seen, so every admitted refresh lands on a
 * reflection someone is looking at. Same cost as the old round-robin, ~8x the
 * useful freshness in the common one-mirror-in-frame view.
 *
 * (Hoisting also keeps the mirror's full scene pass out of the middle of the
 * composite, where it used to pile onto the shadow rebake and the AO recompute
 * in one ~37ms frame.)
