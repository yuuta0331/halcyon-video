// ── Synthetic franchise collections, for the COLLECTION ENDCAPS ─────────────
// The endcap at an aisle end (fixtures/collection-endcap.ts) needs a Jellyfin
// BoxSet with >= 4 owned titles; the three-member "Harness Saga" above is the
// collection-GAP fixture and deliberately stays below that bar. So the demo
// catalog also ships three INVENTED franchises — brand-free by construction,
// which is the whole point: the header card is typeset from the collection
// name, so a committed fallback must not carry anyone's trademark.
//
// Each belongs to ONE library, named per-collection. Real collections belong to
// one aisle, and spreading the same name across all three synthetic libraries
// would merge them into cross-library box sets that no real Jellyfin ever
// produces. Three land in Movies and one in Animated Movies on purpose: the
// selector caps how many of a single library's aisle ends collections may take
// (collectionEndcapReservation + the per-library cap), so a second library is
// what proves the cross-library path in a store deep enough to show it.
//
// Each carries ONE genre for the whole set: a franchise is a franchise, and
// the shelf files a collection under its members' majority category
// (store-layout.ts collectionCategoryOf) — six members with six different
// genres would file the set by coin toss. Slots avoid the SAGA slots
// (3/40/58/76), the series slots (i % 12 === 5) and the low slots the harness
// checkpoints name ("Movies Title 0/1/3"), and stay under 48 so they all exist
// in the default --lib 200 harness store. Within one collection the slots also
// take DISTINCT residues mod the poster-pool size: demoPoster() cycles the
// pool by slot index, so an arithmetic run sharing a factor with the pool
// length would face out the same poster twice down the endcap and read as a
// rendering bug.
