//
// The 1990 store paints no lettering on its walls (owner ruling 2026-08-03;
// see wall-stripe-1990.ts, which leaves the wall carrying only the blue/gold
// stripe), so the wall bays are named the way the gondolas are: a ticket
// signboard card standing on the fixture top, ONE PER SECTION, printed "New
// Releases" — the same card, the same print, the same no-feet flush mount as
// the aisle section signboards (fixtures/ticket-board-sign.ts).
//
// Runs hand themselves in as they are built (store-shell.ts buildShelfRun);
// every card in the store then shares one material and one geometry.
